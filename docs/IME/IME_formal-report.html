    <!-- Alleged Mechanism & History -->
    <div class="section">
      <div class="section-title">III. Alleged Mechanism of Injury & History of Present Illness</div>
      <p>
        Mr. Doe reports that on <strong>06/01/2024</strong>, while employed as a delivery driver with
        ABC Logistics, he was lifting a heavy box from the floor of his truck when he felt an acute onset
        of lower back pain, described as a “sharp pull” across the lumbar region.
      </p>
      <p>
        He states that symptoms began immediately, with difficulty straightening upright and pain radiating
        into the left posterior thigh. He denies a specific fall or direct trauma, but notes that the event
        occurred during a twisting motion while lifting.
      </p>
      <p>
        In subsequent medical visits, the mechanism is generally described consistently as a lifting and
        twisting injury at work on the above date, with some variation in details regarding the weight of
        the box and whether radiating symptoms were present at onset.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Prior Medical History (Relevent) -->
    <div class="section">
      <div class="section-title">IV. Relevant Prior Medical History</div>
      <p>
        Prior records document intermittent episodes of mechanical low back pain dating back to 2018.
        These episodes were typically self-limited, treated conservatively with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
        medications and home exercises. There is no documentation of prior radicular symptoms or prior lumbar
        spine surgery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imaging prior to the 2024 event is limited; there is no lumbar MRI on record before the alleged date
        of injury. Routine primary care visits note mild lumbar spondylosis on plain radiographs in 2021.

        As of the most recent documentation, Mr. Doe reports persistent low back pain rated at
        approximately 4–6/10 with prolonged standing or lifting. He denies current radicular pain.
        He reports difficulty with repetitive bending and lifting tasks but is able to perform basic
        activities of daily living with pacing and modification.
      </p>
      <p>
        He has returned to modified work duties involving primarily light lifting and reduced

          Prior records suggest a baseline of episodic mechanical low back pain associated with
          degenerative changes. The 06/01/2024 lifting event appears to represent an acute
          exacerbation on a background of pre-existing degenerative lumbar disease, with no
          convincing evidence of a new structural lesion beyond what would be expected from
          age-related changes.

    <div class="section">
      <div class="section-title">X. Overall Summary (For IME Narrative)</div>
      <p>
        Mr. John Doe is a 40-year-old delivery driver who reports an acute onset of low back pain
        after a lifting and twisting incident at work on 06/01/2024. Records indicate prompt reporting
        and evaluation in the Emergency Department, followed by ongoing conservative treatment
        including medication and physical therapy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imaging demonstrates degenerative changes of the lumbar spine with mild disc protrusion and
        facet arthropathy, without significant canal compromise or acute fracture. Prior records
        document intermittent low back pain predating the 2024 event, consistent with an underlying
        degenerative process.
      </p>
      <p>
        At last follow-up, Mr. Doe reports partial improvement with residual mechanical back pain
        and functional limitations primarily with heavier physical tasks. There is no documented
        progressive neurologic deficit, and he is working in a modified capacity.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        The examining physician should insert here their independent conclusions regarding
        diagnosis, causation, apportionment (if applicable), maximum medical improvement (MMI), and
        any permanent impairment rating, using jurisdiction-specific standards. The above narrative
        is sample content only.
